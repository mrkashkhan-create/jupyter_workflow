Build an end-to-end pytorch regression model that predicts log_price (named y in notebook) from X. The features have been decided ('feature_cols') and the target should be 'log_price' (y). The dataframe is named 'df_model'. Random seed has been set.
Complete the following tasks to achieve this: 
1. create a scaled train/validate/test split that uses scaling, with StandardScalar. The resulting objects should be "X_train_scaled", "X_val_scaled", "X_test_scaled", "y_train", "y_val", "y_test" and should use a 70-15-15 split strategy. The output variables should be X_train_scaled, X_val_scaled, X_test_scaled, y_train, y_val, y_test
2. create a class named HousePriceDataset(Dataset) and use it with DataLoaders (train_loader, val_loader, test_loader) and a variable BATCH_SIZE=64 to create loaders that support batch loading
3. Create a class named PricePredictorNN using torch.nn to specify the model and ensure that it implements a forward function, the output should be 2D with one column
4. Create training and evaluation functions that implements MAE and MSE losses, and uses the ADAM optimiser. ensure the functions have the following function names and arguments:
 train_epoch(model,dataloader,optimiser,mse_loss_fn,mae_loss_fn,device)
 eval_model(model,dataloader,mse_loss_fn,mae_loss_fn,device)
5. Create a training loop that trains for NUM_EPOCHS = 10
