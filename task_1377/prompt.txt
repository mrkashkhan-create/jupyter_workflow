Complete the following steps to build an end–to-end pytorch classifier model to classify propertyType from a dataset containing one row per property with features like bedrooms, bathrooms and historical price.

complete feature engineering, creating a file named df_model. The features should consist of the following basic numeric features which are already in the dataset:
'bedrooms','livingRooms','bathrooms','floorAreaSqM','latitude','longitude'. You should also create three additional features. 
1. rooms which is equal to 'bedrooms' + 'livingRooms'
2. 'log_price' which is the log of history_price
3. 'propertyType' is categorical, we need to convert this into numberical

You should then create a feature set for classification named feature_cols_cls. It should consist of the following classification features: 
'rooms','bathrooms','floorAreaSqM','latitude','longitude','log_price'

Then create a stratified train-test split named X_train_scaled,X_val_scaled,X_test_scaled and utilising standardScalar for scaling. ensure you use a test size of 0.3 and and random state as SEED (which is already a variable)

implement a pytorch dataset class named PropertyDataset and a set of dataloaders (train_loader, val_loader and test_loader) to train with a batch_size of 64.

Then build a MLP classifier named ProperyTypeClassifier using nn.Module. it should have 128 hidden layers, 4 classes and a forward function. Function selection is upto you,but you should ensure feature output is consistant with what is typically expected

Create a function named train that takes model, loader, criterion, optimiser, epoch as arguments.

create an evaluation function named evaluate with arguments model and loader. Also a function named train_eval that can be used to calculate the variables train_losses, val_losses, val_accuracies
